                <li>Nitzia Y. Davalos Reyes (she/her) Senior/ final semester</li> 
                <li> I transferred from architecture to comm des towards the end of my sophmore year. A friend recommended this class but also taking it as a requirement.  </li>
                <li> Some prior experience with HTML/CSS/JS </li>
                <li> Hope to learn more HTML and CSS and be confident in their application </li>
                <li> Engagement and experience are very distinct on screen compared to on paper design</li>

                    This is the website for a font website that has great design in that it lays out a never ending scroll of font for you to explore or the top bar for more direct searches. This combined with the colors used is very engaging.

                    <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r" > Google Calendar</a>
                    I chose google calender because I think it communicates well what its main use is and components

                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/en/"> Tik Tok </a>
                    It works well and in my case and many others it works a little too well because it keeps you scrolling for a really long time. On desktop beyond just the addicting aspect of the algorith the layout too keeps you scrolling because of how it is laid out.
