            <h2>Mexican Flan</h2>
            <p> Flan is a delicious custard made with eggs and a few other ingredients. The recipe for flan varies immensely from country to country and even region to region within a country. There is Spanish flan, Mexican flan, Cuban flan, and the list goes on.</p> 
            <h3>Ingredient</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 can of condensed milk</li>
                    <li>1 can of evaporated milk</li>
                    <li> 6eggs</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla</li>
                    <li>1 cup sugar</li>
                    <li>hot water for water bath</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350Â°</li>
                <li>Add all ingredients except sugar and water to blender. Blend for 2 minutes or until everything is fully blended. Set aside.</li>
                <li>In a small saucepan over medium heat place sugar and stir. As it starts melting stir constantly to ensure even melting and avoid burning. A caramel will start forming and continue stirring until all of the sugar is melted and you have a golden colored caramel. Be careful not to burn the caramel and take off heat as soon as it is melted and golden.</li>
                <li>Immediately transfer caramel to pie dish and carefully swirl it around to ensure the bottom of the dish is fully covered. Placed dish in large roasting pan or any baking pan where the pie dish will fit into.</li>
                <li>Pour egg mixture through a sieve and into pie dish.</li>
                <li>Carefully add hot water to roasting pan being careful not to pour water into pie dish. You can do this before placing pan in the oven or after you've placed the pan on an oven rack to avoid spilling everything in the transfer. Add enough hot water to cover halfway up the pie dish.</li>
                <li>Bake for 40-50 minutes until toothpick comes out clean and it is golden on top. Time may vary depending on oven.</li>
                <li>Carefully remove roasting pan from oven and remove pie dish from water bath. Leave flan to cool completely before placing in the refrigerator. Leave in refrigerator overnight or at least for a couple of hours.</li>
                <li>Run a small knife around the flan to loosen up the sides and ensure there is nothing stuck to the pie dish.</li>
                <li>Place a large plate over the pie dish and flip flan over quickly. The caramel turned into a delicious sauce that will be coating the entire flan.</li>
                <li>Serve with fresh fruit or as is!</li>

                    <p>Food Network website homebase is very imagery heavy which is effective in terms of recipe websites because it makes them alluring. The recipes themselves are also well organized and orgonazied with mutiple columns on the page instead of scrolling up and down.</p> 
                </li>
                <li> 
                    <a href="https://dorastable.com/" > Dora's Table</a>
                    <p> This is a recipe from a chef named Dora Stone. The website is more of a blog so has a personal touch for recipes which is effective for the purpose of the site since it is all about vegan/vegetarain Mexican cuisine thus the personality behind the website gives the recipes a degree of authenticity. The recipe pages are also useful in that they have a compact dtlr of the insturctions at the end of the page with a printable layout.</p> 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.delish.com/"> Delish </a>
                    <p> This website larger inventory is divided by categrories beyond the basic divisions which can get more engagement. The recipes have a vertical empahasis with the typical scroll down use though ingredients do remain in a columns beside the instructions which can be useful when actually cooking</p>

                    <p>This website is a bit chaotic for my vision of the recipe site however I do like the creative liberties such as the vibrant colors and animated features.</p> 
                </li>
                <li> 
                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G3UA5WC5S5UUKB5G" > Amazon Customer Reviews</a>
                    <p> I did not know what to reference so amazon item reviews came to mind but the use of viewer engagemnt would be interesting so shaping either the completed recipe or little differences done by each person who made the recipe.</p> 
                </li>

                    <a href="https://www.target.com/p/latino-heritage-month-wide-brim-adjustable-rancher-hat-black/-/A-88106209#lnk=sametab"> Target </a>
                    <p> Also could not find a better example but the referenceing to local shops of ingredients in the recipe such as target does to see if an item is available near you could be useful and higlight local businesses.</p>
