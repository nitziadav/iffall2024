            [Verse 1]
            Nobody likes you nobody cares
            Nobody wants you nobody dares
            To extend a greeting, a connecting glance
            Life is just a jaded game to them
            They won't give it a chance
            But you know and I know
            That the galaxies are all around us
            And life will flow on
            As long as the grass grows and the water runs
            And while I'm here on earth
            I'll rejoice in it's worth
            
            [Chorus]
            'Cause freedom is free
            Freedom is free
            And you can't take that away from me
            You got your guns up on display
            But you can't control how I feel no way
            'Cause freedom is free
            Freedom is free
            And you can't take that away from nobody
            
            [Verse 2]
            Because the ocean is all around us
            And life will flow on
            As long as there are ripples in the waves
            And sun rays from the sun
            And while I'm here on earth
            I'll rejoice in it's worth
        

            [Chorus]
            'Cause freedom is free
            Freedom is free
            And you can't take that away from me
            You got your guns up on display
            But you can't control how I feel no way
            'Cause freedom is free
            And that's the way it's always gonna be
            Freedom is free
            And no amount of negativity can put a dent in me
            
            [Outro]
            Freedom is free
            Freedom is free
            Freedom is free
            Freedom is free
            Freedom is free
            Freedom is free
