            <ol class="instructions">
                <li>Preheat oven to 350Â°</li>
                <li>Add all ingredients except sugar and water to blender. Blend for 2 minutes or until everything is fully blended. Set aside.</li>
                <li>In a small saucepan over medium heat place sugar and stir. As it starts melting stir constantly to ensure even melting and avoid burning. A caramel will start forming and continue stirring until all of the sugar is melted and you have a golden colored caramel. Be careful not to burn the caramel and take off heat as soon as it is melted and golden.</li>
                <li>Immediately transfer caramel to pie dish and carefully swirl it around to ensure the bottom of the dish is fully covered. Placed dish in large roasting pan or any baking pan where the pie dish will fit into.</li>
                <li>Pour egg mixture through a sieve and into pie dish.</li>
                <li>Carefully add hot water to roasting pan being careful not to pour water into pie dish. You can do this before placing pan in the oven or after you've placed the pan on an oven rack to avoid spilling everything in the transfer. Add enough hot water to cover halfway up the pie dish.</li>
                <li>Bake for 40-50 minutes until toothpick comes out clean and it is golden on top. Time may vary depending on oven.</li>
                <li>Carefully remove roasting pan from oven and remove pie dish from water bath. Leave flan to cool completely before placing in the refrigerator. Leave in refrigerator overnight or at least for a couple of hours.</li>
                <li>Run a small knife around the flan to loosen up the sides and ensure there is nothing stuck to the pie dish.</li>
                <li>Place a large plate over the pie dish and flip flan over quickly. The caramel turned into a delicious sauce that will be coating the entire flan.</li>
                <li>Serve with fresh fruit or as is!</li>
